# Note: The control.*.glade -> control.*.xml symlink is required to make xgettext
# auto-detect the type of this file (glade) so it will extract all
# <label>..</label> tags. The symlink is created in the toplevel
# configure.in.in file upon "autoconf" (via "make -f Makefile.cvs").
# Unfortunately, CVS doesn't support checking in symlinks - it would duplicate
# the file. 

# Distribute also the generated control.rng file, the reason is that "trang"
# is a Java tool which adds huge dependency in OBS.
#
# The conversion happens during "make package" when building the tarball.
# The RNG file gets automatically updated after any change by the "control.rng"
# rule below.
#
# At build time the RNG file from tarball will have a newer time stamp
# and thus it will not need rebuild/update making "trang" unnecessary.
